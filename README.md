# Crypto Profit APP

>Whenever I was searching on the internet for a simple calculator to do some quick math I could never find one... there was mining calculators for sure but not what I was looking for. So ! I decided to make my own and share with anyone having the same trouble as I once did. This was my first attempt at creating something with react and I feel like I still have so much to learn. I regret not using Redux and Typescript as the scope of the project quickly grew beyond my initial expectations as I was adding more and more features.
